This is a project created using Java. In this project concepts of linked lists have been used. The application will have 5 sections- Management, Patient, Patient Database, Clear Screen ,and Exit. If you choose Management then to enter into it you will have to enter a code that management people will only be knowing. Here the code is "ho". In Management, you have 4 options- Doctor, Junior Doctor, Nurses, and workers. In Doctor, Junior Doctor, and Nurses you have options to sign up, sign in and show the database. In sign up new members are added In sign in the members can change their available time In the show database name, the time at which they are available and a number of patients they have to attend are shown. Number of patients is not shown in junior doctors and nurses. Workers also have sign up, sign in and show database options By doing sign in they can inform management as to which shift they will be coming If we select Patient, then all doctors available along with the time thier availability time is shown. The patient can select the doctor and confirm his meeting with the selected doctor. Patient Database shows name of all patients along with doctors they will be seeing.
